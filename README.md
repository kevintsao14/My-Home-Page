# My-Home-Page
# Personal Website with AI Chatbot

## High-Level Concept

This project is a personal website that opens with an AI chatbot interface—rather than a typical static page—designed to answer questions about my background, interests, projects, and more. Users can interact with the chatbot to learn about me in an engaging, conversational way, as the bot pulls answers from a custom knowledge base.

## Core Goals

- **Engaging Experience:** Provide an interactive and conversational method for visitors to learn about me.
- **Centralized Data:** Consolidate personal and professional information (bio, portfolio, achievements, blog content, etc.) into a single knowledge base.
- **Showcase Technical Skills:** Demonstrate my expertise and creativity with a custom, AI-driven user experience.

## Feature Requirements

1. **Chat Interface (Home Page)**
   - A user-friendly chat box where visitors can type questions.
   - Optional starter prompts or suggested questions to help initiate the conversation.

2. **Knowledge Base**
   - Data about me including biography, portfolio, achievements, social media posts, and blog content.
   - A structured method to store and retrieve this data for the AI.

3. **AI Model Integration**
   - Integration of an API or local model that processes queries, references the knowledge base, and returns natural language answers.
   - Use of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques to dynamically fetch relevant information from the dataset.

## UI Enhancements

I plan to enhance my project’s user interface by dynamically revealing additional text and images whenever the API response contains certain keywords. This behavior will occur on the client side in real-time, without requiring a page refresh.
